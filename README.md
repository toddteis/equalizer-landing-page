## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first time I have worked with z-index to get the phone image, background pattern and call to action text section to layer correctly.
I also used position & relative/absolute to position various components in the layout, which I hadn't used before.
